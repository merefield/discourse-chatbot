    prompt:
      system:
        basic: "You are a helpful assistant."
        agent: "You are a helpful assistant.  You have great tools in the form of functions that give you the power to get newer information. Only use the functions you have been provided with.  The current date and time is %{current_date_time}.  Only respond to the last question, using the prior information as context, if appropriate."
      title: "The subject of this conversation is %{topic_title}"
      first_post: "The first thing someone said was %{username} who said %{raw}"

      function:
        calculator:
          description: |
            Useful for getting the result of a math expression.  It is a general purpose calculator.  It works with Ruby expressions.

            You can retrieve the current date from it too and using the core Ruby Time method to calculate dates.

            The input to this tool should be a valid mathematical expression that could be executed by the base Ruby programming language with no extensions.

            Be certain to prefix any functions with 'Math.'

            Usage:
              Action Input: 1 + 1

              Action Input: Time.now - 2 * 24 * 60 * 60
              Action Input: Math.cbrt(13) + Math.cbrt(12)
              Action Input: Math.sqrt(8)
              Action Input: (4.1 + 2.3) / (2.0 - 5.6) * 3
          parameters:
            input: the mathematical expression you need to process and get the answer to. Make sure it is Ruby compatible.
